# SideBar Folders

### Description

Provides a new item "Folders" in the menubar, to allow a quick switch of the folders opened in the sidebar; for Sublime Text. See: http://www.sublimetext.com/

For some users.. (me :P), the ST project system is too much.. I just want to be able to switch folders without saving or tracking project files, and keeping Tabs intact.. well, this package does just that.

The menuitem fills up automatically, you don't need to do anything.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

`super + shift + o` opens the list of folders in a quick panel. With this you can quickly change folders from the keyboard.
(to remap, point your keyboard shortcut to this command: `side_bar_folders_quick_switch`)
